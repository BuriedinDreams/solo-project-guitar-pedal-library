3,1,"TS9 Tube Screamer","The Tube Screamer, which various reviews give the honorific ""legendary"", has been used by many guitarists to create their signature sound, and is one of the most successful, widely copied, and custom-modified (""modded"") overdrive pedals in the history of the electric guitar.","https://media.sweetwater.com/api/i/ha-a5b2f4b2a4a1bdee__hmac-569768f54171c2ef16206f437972d6232126d6c0/images/items/750/TS9-large.jpg"
6,1,"Vox Wah Pedal"," is a type of electric guitar effects pedal that alters the tone and frequencies of the guitar signal to create a distinctive sound, mimicking the human voice saying the onomatopoeic name ""wah-wah"". The pedal sweeps the peak response of a frequency filter up and down in frequency to create the sound, a spectral glide, also known as ""the wah effect"". The wah-wah effect originated in the 1920s, with trumpet or trombone players finding they could produce an expressive crying tone by moving a mute in and out of the instrument's bell. This was later simulated with electronic circuitry for the electric guitar when the wah-wah pedal was invented. It is controlled by movement of the player's foot on a rocking pedal connected to a potentiometer. Wah-wah effects are used when a guitarist is soloing, or creating a ""wacka-wacka"" funk-styled rhythm for rhythm guitar playing.","https://static.musiciansfriend.com/derivates/19/001/190/416/DV020_Jpg_Jumbo_151058_R.jpg"

10,1,"MXR Phase 90 Pedal","The MXR Phase 90 has been a pedalboard staple since the mid-1970s. Since its introduction, this classic stompbox has remained relatively unchanged with just a single knob to control the speed of the phase shifting. When on a lower setting, the sound moves slower for broader sonic swells, while higher speeds offer more warbly motion. Whether you're chasing that Van Halen tone, trying to funk up your cleans or just experimenting, the single-knob Phase 90 is a proven place to enter the world of phase shifters.","https://images.reverb.com/image/upload/s--CrzDX_K2--/f_auto,t_large/v1552401080/zrlfmzj3h7g5tbzxxex6.jpg"

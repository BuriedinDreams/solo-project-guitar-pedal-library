## Guitar Pedal Library

# Description

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

This application is a Guitar Pedal Library social media site. In this application you will be able to look through a vast collection of guitar pedals. What makes this application unique is that it gives users the ability to add photos of guitar pedals, a description, and users are able to add YouTube videos that will be seen on said guitar pedal page.

To see the app in the action go to https://guitar-pedal-library.herokuapp.com/#/home

## Prerequisites

To start this project please have these set of software programs downloaded to your computer.

- A code editor of your choice VS Code OR Sublime Text
- postgreSQL
- Node.js
- Postico

# installation of app

- Clone code from Github
- Open the project folder in an editor of your choice.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run an npm install

- Once you have this application installed to your own personal computer open your database application of choice. This project is built with Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico create a database and to run the queries.
- In said database name the file `Guitar_Project`. Once you create the file you will need to open the 'solo-project-guitar-pedal-library' file in your code editor of choice. Once the project is open navigate to the file called the `database.sql` file and copy all of the data "command + a", then paste it into the SQl database Postico. Once you've pasted the information from database.sql use "command + a" to highlight all of the information again and then click execute. This should then create all the tables and have one example pedal created in the system for viewing.

- Once that is completed the task above head back to your preferred coding editor and do the following steps.

- Open a new terminal by navigating to to the top of your computer > then click 'New Terminal'
- Run npm run server in your terminal
- Run npm run client in your terminal
- The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
